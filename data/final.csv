;Does Amazon SageMaker support distributed training?;Yes. Amazon SageMaker can automatically distribute deep learning models and large training sets across AWS GPU instances in a fraction of the time it takes to build and optimize these distribution strategies manually.

;How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?;Though both supervised and reinforcement learning use mapping between input and output, unlike supervised learning where the feedback provided to the agent is the correct set of actions for performing a task, reinforcement learning uses a delayed feedback where reward signals are optimized to ensure a long-term goal through a sequence of actions.;train model
;In what ways does reinforcement learning contrast with supervised learning?;Supervised and reinforcement learning employ input-output mapping, but unlike supervised learning which offers the agent immediate feedback through the correct actions for a task, reinforcement learning utilizes a deferred feedback mechanism using optimized reward signals, allowing the sequence of actions to achieve long-term goals.;train model
;In what ways does reinforcement learning differ from supervised learning?;Even though supervised and reinforcement learning involve linking input and output, the difference lies in the feedback received by the agent. In supervised learning, the agent is given correct actions to perform a task as feedback, but reinforcement learning provides delayed feedback through reward signals optimized to achieve long-term goals through a sequence of actions.;train model
;How does reinforcement learning contrast with supervised learning?;While supervised and reinforcement learning both involve establishing a connection between input and output, the contrast between the two lies in the type of feedback obtained by the agent.
