SageMaker Ground Truth will first select a random sample of data and send it to Amazon Mechanical Turk to be labeled. The results are then used to train a labeling model that attempts to label a new sample of raw data automatically. The labels are committed when the model can label the data with a confidence score that meets or exceeds a threshold you set. Where the confidence score falls below your threshold, the data is sent to human labelers. Some of the data labeled by humans is used to generate a new training dataset for the labeling model, and the model is automatically retrained to improve its accuracy. This process repeats with each sample of raw data to be labeled. The labeling model becomes more capable of automatically labeling raw data with each iteration, and less data is routed to humans.

With Managed Spot Training, you can reduce the cost of training your machine learning models by up to 90%.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "How does Managed Spot Training work?", "answer": "Managed Spot Training uses Amazon EC2 Spot instances for training, and these instances can be pre-empted when AWS needs capacity. As a result, Managed Spot Training jobs can run in small increments as and when capacity becomes available. The training jobs need not be restarted from scratch when there is an interruption as Amazon SageMaker can resume the training jobs using the latest model checkpoint. The built-in frameworks and the built-in computer vision algorithms with SageMaker enable periodic checkpoints, and you can enable checkpoints with custom models.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "Do I need to periodically checkpoint with Managed Spot Training?", "answer": "We recommend periodic checkpoints as a general best practice for long running training jobs.

It aims to optimize a customer specified objective metric throughout the tuning process. Specifically, it checks the object metric of completed training jobs, and leverages the knowledge to infer the hyperparameter combination for the next training job.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "Will you recommend specific hyperparameters for tuning?", "answer": "No. How certain hyperparameters impact the model performance depends on various factors and it is hard to definitively say one hyperparameter is more important than the others and thus needs to be tuned. For built-in algorithms within Amazon SageMaker, we do call out whether or not a hyperparameter is tunable.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "How long does a hyperparameter tuning job take?", "answer": "The length of time for a hyperparameter tuning job depends on multiple factors including the size of the data, the underlying algorithm, and the values of the hyperparameters. Additionally, customers can choose the number of simultaneous training jobs and total number of training jobs. All these choices affect how long a hyperparameter tuning job can last.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "Can I optimize multiple objectives simultaneously like a model to be both fast and accurate?", "answer": "Not at this time. Right now, you need to specify a single objective metric to optimize or change your algorithm code to emit a new metric, which is a weighted average between two or more useful metrics, and have the tuning process optimize towards that objective metric.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "How much does Automatic Model Tuning cost?", "answer": "There is no charge for a hyperparameter tuning job itself.

Automatic Model Tuning, on the other hand, is designed to tune any model, no matter whether it is based on built-in algorithms, deep learning frameworks, or custom containers. In exchange for the flexibility, you have to manually pick the specific algorithm, determine the hyperparameters to tune, and corresponding search ranges.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "What is reinforcement learning?", "answer": "Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "Can I train reinforcement learning models in Amazon SageMaker?", "answer": "Yes, you can train reinforcement learning models in Amazon SageMaker in addition to supervised and unsupervised learning models.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?", "answer": "Though both supervised and reinforcement learning use mapping between input and output, unlike supervised learning where the feedback provided to the agent is correct set of actions for performing a task, reinforcement learning uses a delayed feedback where reward signals are optimized to ensure a long-term goal through a sequence of actions.", "found_duplicate": false}, {"question": "When should I use reinforcement learning?", "answer": "While the goal of supervised learning techniques is to find the right answer based on the patterns in the training data, the goal of unsupervised learning techniques is to find similarities and differences between data points. In contrast, the goal of reinforcement learning techniques is to learn how to achieve a desired outcome even when it is not clear how to accomplish that outcome.
